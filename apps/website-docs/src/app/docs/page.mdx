# Introduction

Ether Auth is a flexible, framework-independent authentication and authorization solution for TypeScript. It offers a rich set of built-in features and a plugin system that makes integrating advanced functionalitiesâ€”like multi-tenancy and SSOâ€”effortless. With Ether Auth, you can focus on building your app instead of managing authentication from scratch.

### Why Ether Auth?

Authentication in the TypeScript ecosystem has often been incomplete, with many libraries requiring extra code for anything beyond the basics. Instead of relying solely on third-party services, Ether Auth aims to provide a more robust, community-driven solution. ðŸš€
